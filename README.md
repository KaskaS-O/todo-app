## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [beautiful-react-dnd](https://github.com/atlassian/react-beautiful-dnd) - library for beautiful and accessible drag and drop for lists with React

### What I learned

This was a good project to learn further about data-flow in React. Creating a todo list which allows you to manage the tasks, filter them by different criteria, add and delete tasks was challenging. Different methods required to use data from another method, changing the state of app on many different ways.

There were some CSS tricks required as well - the biggest difficulty was to style a checkbox border with linear gradient (some useful article on the subject can be found in Useful resources section).

### Useful resources

- [Boder with gradient and radius on dev.to](https://dev.to/afif/border-with-gradient-and-radius-387f) - This helped me to handle CSS border-image property and adjust it to create rounded border with linear gradient as background.

- [Beautiful and Accessible Drag and Drop with react-beautiful-dnd](beautiful-and-accessible-drag-and-drop-with-react-beautiful-dnd) - A very useful course of using beautiful-react-dnd library. Presents the basics of lib usage and main features.
